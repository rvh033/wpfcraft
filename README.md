## WPFCraft
This is WPFCraft, do whatever you want with it.
WPFCraft is a 2D Minecraft/Terraria-like sandbox game written in C# for the Windows Presentation Foundation.
Absolutely stupid of course, because WPF is not at all meant for game development.
Yet I didn't care and did it anyway.

## Building
It's a WPF app, so don't try running it on Linux or Crapple macOS.

Open the wpfcraft.sln file with Visual Studio and hit Ctrl+B. Make sure you have the dotnet 8 sdk installed.
